        The architects and craftsmen of the Taj Mahal were masters of
        proportions and tricks of the eye. When you first approach the main gate
        that frames the Taj, for example, the monument appears incredibly close
        and large. But as you get closer, it shrinks in size—exactly the
        opposite of what you’d expect. And although the minarets surrounding the
        tomb look perfectly upright, the towers actually lean outward, which
        serves both form and function: in addition to providing aesthetic
        balance, the pillars would crumble away from the main crypt in a
        disaster like an earthquake.

        Great Wall Of China,China

        The Great Wall of China (traditional Chinese: 萬里長城; simplified
        Chinese: 万里长城; pinyin: Wànlǐ Chángchéng) is a series of
        fortifications that were built across the historical northern borders of
        ancient Chinese states and Imperial China as protection against various
        nomadic groups from the Eurasian Steppe. Several walls were built from
        as early as the 7th century BC,[4] with selective stretches later joined
        together by Qin Shi Huang (220–206 BC), the first emperor of China.
        Little of the Qin wall remains.[5] Later on, many successive dynasties
        built and maintained multiple stretches of border walls. The best-known
        sections of the wall were built by the Ming dynasty (1368–1644). Apart
        from defense, other purposes of the Great Wall have included border
        controls, allowing the imposition of duties on goods transported along
        the Silk Road, regulation or encouragement of trade and the control of
        immigration and emigration.[6] Furthermore, the defensive
        characteristics of the Great Wall were enhanced by the construction of
        watchtowers, troop barracks, garrison stations, signaling capabilities
        through the means of smoke or fire, and the fact that the path of the
        Great Wall also served as a transportation corridor. The frontier walls
        built by different dynasties have multiple courses. Collectively, they
        stretch from Liaodong in the east to Lop Lake in the west, from the
        present-day Sino–Russian border in the north to Tao River (Taohe) in the
        south; along an arc that roughly delineates the edge of the Mongolian
        steppe; spanning 21,196.18 km (13,170.70 mi) in total.[7][3] Today, the
        defensive system of the Great Wall is generally recognized as one of the
        most impressive architectural feats in history.

        The Colosseum (/ˌkɒləˈsiːəm/ KOL-ə-SEE-əm; Italian: Colosseo
        [kolosˈsɛːo]) is an oval amphitheatre in the centre of the city of Rome,
        Italy, just east of the Roman Forum. It is the largest ancient
        amphitheatre ever built, and is still the largest standing amphitheatre
        in the world today, despite its age. Construction began under the
        emperor Vespasian (r. 69–79 AD) in 72[1] and was completed in 80 AD
        under his successor and heir, Titus (r. 79–81).[2] Further modifications
        were made during the reign of Domitian (r. 81–96).[3] The three emperors
        that were patrons of the work are known as the Flavian dynasty, and the
        amphitheatre was named the Flavian Amphitheatre (Latin: Amphitheatrum
        Flavium; Italian: Anfiteatro Flavio [aɱfiteˈaːtro ˈflaːvjo]) by later
        classicists and archaeologists for its association with their family
        name (Flavius).[citation needed] The Colosseum is built of travertine
        limestone, tuff (volcanic rock), and brick-faced concrete.
